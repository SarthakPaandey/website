# Announcing Cake for Yeoman

Yeoman users rejoice! You can now bootstrap your project for Cake with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and the new `generator-cake` generator.

<!--excerpt-->

If you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) already installed, simply run the following commands to quickly get started with Yeoman and Cake:

```
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-cake
```

Then, from your terminal, just run `yo cake` to quickly bootstrap Cake, including a build script, bootstrapper scripts and config files in the current folder.

You can also install each of these individually using `yo cake:config` or `yo cake:bootstrapper`.

## Frosting

Finally, you can also use our (experimental) generator for [Frosting](https://cakebuild.net/docs/running-builds/runners/cake-frosting) to quickly setup a new .NET Core project using Frosting:

```
yo cake:frosting
```
